# Thanksgiving-Dinner-America-2015-Analysis

This project illustrates the use of Pandas for Data Analysis with Python. Using the [dataset](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/thanksgiving-2015) for [Thanksgiving Dinner in America](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-what-your-part-of-america-eats-on-thanksgiving/), we explore the powerful grouping and aggregation abilities of Pandas such as pattern discovery, slicing your data in numerous ways and group summary statistics. 

We dive into the dataset to find answers to juicy questions like:
- Exploring what main dishes people tend to eat during Thanksgiving dinner?
- How many people eat Apple, Pecan, or Pumpkin pie?

And we'll try to derive insights like:
- Is there a relation between the distance someone travels for Thanksgiving dinner and their income level?
- Is there a relation between "Friendship" and "Age"?
